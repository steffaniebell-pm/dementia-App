## Copy style (quick summary)

- Use plain labels and short button text.
- Keep one primary action per screen when possible.
- Use calm, supportive wording and avoid technical UI terms.

## Recent update summary (PR-style)

### Feature: Dementia-friendly jigsaw puzzle in Brain Games

- Added a dedicated puzzle flow when a patient starts **Problem Solving**.
- Implemented a gentle 2x2 tap-to-swap jigsaw (large tiles, simple instructions, shuffle/reset).
- Prevented star claiming until puzzle completion for this category.
- Kept other game categories on the existing generic gameplay flow.

### Navigation and UI wiring

- `GamePlay` now receives selected game category via navigation params.
- Brain Games start buttons pass category context to gameplay.
- `LargeButton` now supports a disabled state for accessible action gating.

### Validation

- TypeScript check passed: `npx tsc --noEmit` (exit 0).
